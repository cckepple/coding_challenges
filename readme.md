## No Frameworks User Login / Registration ##
`Tech: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery (2.2.4), PHP 5.6, Sqlite3`
***

This is my attempt at a coding challenge provided by a potential employeer   
These were the provided instructions for task completion:
   
   >Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite, create a registration/sign-in page. You may optionally use jQuery, but otherwise, no frameworks or libraries, please.
 
`Information to collect on registration:`

1. Email Address
2. Name
3. Username
4. Password
 
>In addition to collecting information from the user, the database should store when the user registered and last logged in.

Here is the result! ([live demo](http://coreykepple.xyz "Demo"))
